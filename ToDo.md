# To Do


## v0.1.0

- [X] Create Window
- [X] Generate random points using a Star Class
- [X] Add basic rendering
- [X] Add star colour and brightness (Short Lived Code for testing)
- [X] Get proper properties
    ### Given
    - [X] Temperature
    - [X] Star X
    - [X] Star Y
    - [X] Star Distance to observer
    - [X] Size
    ### Need to be calculated
    - [ ] Absolute Luminosity: How the star looks 32.6 light years away (This is for the star class)
    - [ ] Apparent luminosity: How the star looks distance light years away (This is for rendering)

- [ ] Star Classification Function
    - [ ] Temperature / Spectral Type: (M, K, G, F, A, B, O), 1-9 for each class. Like G2 or 2K
    - [ ] Absolute Luminosity / Luminosity Class: (I, II, III, ...)
    - This should look like G2V or K2II

- [ ] Render Stars
    - [ ] Colour Rendering based on star class letter
    - [ ] Brightness Rendering based on apparent roman numeral
    - [ ] Make it render a star like shape

- [ ] Polish

- [ ] Pause and Play buttons
- [ ] Change year when played

- [ ] Add rate of change properties for each star
